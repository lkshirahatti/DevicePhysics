## Bloch Theorem

The theorem states that all one-electron wave functions, for problems involving periodically varying potential energy functions, must be of the form:  

`ψ(x) = u(x) · exp(j · k · x)`

## Two basic transport mechanisms in a semiconductor crystal:
1. Drift—the movement of charge due to electric fields  
2. Diffusion—the flow of charge due to density gradients

The carrier transport phenomena are the foundation for finally determining the current–voltage characteristics of semiconductor devices.

Excess electrons and excess holes do not move independently of each other.
These excess carriers diffuse, drift, and recombine with the same effective diffusion coefficient, drift mobility, and lifetime. 
This phenomenon is called **ambipolar transport**.

Excess carriers dominate the electrical properties of a semiconductor material, and the behavior of excess carriers is fundamental to the
operation of semiconductor devices.

For an extrinsic semiconductor under low injection, the effective diffusion coefficient and mobility parameters are those of the **minority carrier**.
