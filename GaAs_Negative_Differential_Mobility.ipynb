    "# Understanding Negative Differential Mobility in Gallium Arsenide (GaAs)\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook explains the unique **drift velocity vs electric field** characteristics of **Gallium Arsenide (GaAs)** at **T = 300 K**, including the concept of **negative differential mobility (NDM)** and its physical origin.\n",

    "## 1. Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "At **low electric fields**, GaAs shows high **electron mobility** due to the low **effective mass** in the **lower valley** of its conduction band:\n",

    "At **high electric fields**, the drift velocity reaches a **peak** and then **decreases**, a behavior known as **velocity saturation** followed by **negative differential mobility** (NDM).\n",

    "  - **Lower valley** with effective mass $$m^*_1 = 0.067 m_0$$\n",

    "This **intervalley transfer** reduces the average drift velocity, creating a region of **negative differential mobility**.\n",

    "The negative differential mobility produces a negative differential resistance; this characteristic is used in the design of oscillators.\n",
